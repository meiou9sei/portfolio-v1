                    <br>&emsp;I've been going climbing a while. Specifically bouldering, the last few months. My brother's been bugging me for a lot longer but I hadn't given it a try till this summer. 
                    <br><br>&emsp;It's a nice feeling. Every route is a mix of brain and brawn. Holds are placed in puzzling spots you must creatively solve and needed is an endurance to execute your plan. It's not enough to just be strong or smart. And that's refreshing.
                    <br><br>&emsp;I've tried weight-lifting for years to no avail, never staying consistent enough to see big results. It's always been boring, the actions routine and static. There's nothing new when it comes to lifting, your lifts are pre-planned and movements executed the same way every time. Contrast that with the dynamic ways climbing challenges you. I look forward to climbing twice a week. 
                    <br><br>&emsp;Back in college, I didn't know what I wanted to do. I chose political science as my major, off a vague interest in politics and history. But it wasn't too exciting. Sure it felt nice exploring the nuances of history and seeing how the world of politics had developed to today's grid of international relations. To learn the inner goings of institutions and how they shape the lives of everyone. But something was missing. Reading books, writing essays, listening to lectures - the topic may change but the routine was same. Nothing I did seemingly mattered, all to do was go through the motions. 
                    <br><br>&emsp;I started learning programming in my senior year. It's something I had been always interested in but thought would be too difficult, requiring math I could never solve after a disinterest in highschool leading to mediocre grades. But to my surprise, actual programming didn't require much in math. Sure, a degree in computer science may require calculus and physics and theory beyond my level. But learning how to code, I quickly saw how much of it was using logic and approaches from multiple angles. Sure there was a set of routines I needed learn by heart, methods and functions, to go through the motions, but there was also problem solving. Just like climbing.
                    <br><br>&emsp;My good friend introduced me to MAIP that year. I didn't think I'd get in, nor did I have a particular interest in advertising before. But the creative tech role intrigued me, the ability to combine not only tech but my creative abilities was something I had never thought of doing. I'd done some art and video production in my past for fun, but never imagined I could make a living off it. 
                    <br><br>&emsp;Accepted into the program, I started learning the intricacies of the advertising field. Seeing how it all worked, how I would fit into this machine that delivered a message, a culmination of dozens of peoples' work, involving problem solving and, as with anything, some routine movements - it all drew me in. 
                    <br><br>&emsp;I've been interning as a webdev for a while. Specifically, creative tech, the last month. A field I had never dreamed of entering, but I gave it a try and now I'm enjoying it.
                    <br><br>&emsp;It's a nice feeling.
